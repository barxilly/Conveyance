# Conveyance

> [!NOTE]
> Some code was written using the GitHub Copilot inline generation, these are only non-core, perhaps repetitive sections and the games logic and functioning are still my own.

## Installation

Visit the [releases](releases) page and download the latest release/pre-release for your system. Conveyance currently supports:

| Platform | File                 | Store                                                                                                |

| Console  | N/A                  | _I'd have to rebuild Löve for each OS, unless I get very wealthy I do not have the time for that..._ |

## Play from Source

To play from source you will need to have Löve installed on your system. You can download it from the [Löve website](https://love2d.org/). Once you have Löve installed, clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
love .
```

## Future Prospects and Monetisation

Despite the open-source nature of this game, I will be monetising it through the game being paid-for on all platforms. This is to help fund future projects and to help me continue to develop games. Prices to be determined.
People will still be allowed to play the game for free by building it from source, but may not distribute the game without my permission and will not be able to use features such as Steam, Google Play, etc achievements.
